What we're trying to accomplish here is an addon that:

- adds an icon to the toolbar
- detects whether or not a site has a contribute.json file in its root dir, 
  e.g http://mozilla.org/contribute.json 
- changes to a suitably representative icon - A bolt, maybe?
- Presents the suitably styled and html-ified contents of that contribute.json file when clicked.

That's it.
